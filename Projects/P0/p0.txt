.SH NAME
Ex0 \- Command Line
.SH SYNOPSIS
The goal of this project was to add a kernel boot debug message to Reptilian. 
.SH DESCRIPTION
1. I started by searching for the function 'rcu_end_inkernel_boot()' using the grep command, since this function
was mentioned in the project files.
.br .br
2. The output of the command indicated that the file that contained this function was main.c in the directory
'/usr/rep/src/reptilian-kernel/init/'
.br .br
3. Once I navigated to this file I used nano to edit it. I was lead to believe that one of the functions, either 
printk() or pr_info(), was the way to to print out a line because of a link I discovered provided in the references. [1]
.br .br
5. Using this infornmation I searched through the main.c file for examples of those functions and found an example of
pr_info(). Assuming this was the correct syntax I replicated this command before the function stated above with my 
message. 
.br .br
6. After this I saved the file and rebuilt the kernel. When going through the screen recording of the debug boot screen 
the message appeared correctly
.br .br
7. For the extra credit I stumbled across a link that mentioned the file menu.lst would be the file necessary to edit
the GRUB menu. The link will be provided below. [2]
.br .br
8. With this infornmation I ran the find command to locate the menu.lst file which was located in the directory 
'/mnt/sysroot/gurb/'
.br .br
9. After I navigated to the directory I edited the menu.lst file with the nano command and simply added my name
at the end of the first boot option.
.SH TESTING
Tested by going through the boot logs using the dmesg command mentioned in Piazza. Also by shuting down and starting 
my VM to check for the extra credit
.SH BUGS
My initial attempt to edit the main.c file resulted in the VM crashing upon booting up. wasn't able to diagnose why,
I ended up using a snapshot I created earlier to get my VM up again.
